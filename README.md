# Project-Iris
A robotic intervention to help the visually challenged commute


We plan to build a fully autonomous Robot which will
help the visually challenged to travel from one place to
another.The robot will deploy an array of sensors to detect and
avoid the obstacles along the path at the same time.
We plan to use machine learning to train the robot to
understand how to respond to different obstacles.
